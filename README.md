# Orbitport cTRNG Oracle Contracts

This repository contains the entrypoint contracts for **Orbitport cTRNG (cosmic True Random Number Generator)** randomness on-chain integration. These contracts serve as the bridge between SpaceComputer's orbital randomness services and blockchain applications.

## Overview

### What is Orbitport cTRNG?

**Orbitport** is a gateway to orbital services such as `cTRNG` (cosmic True Random Number Generator) or `spaceTEE`, served by multiple providers & satellites to ensure high availability and reliability. The cTRNG service provides true random numbers harvested from hardware on satellites, currently supporting `cEDGE` and `Crypto2` by `Aptos Orbital`. The satellite also signs the generated data to ensure it was generated by the satellite and was not tampered with.

### How It Works

1. **Randomness Retrieval**: Randomness is retrieved via cTRNG using the [Orbitport TypeScript SDK](https://docs.spacecomputer.io/)
2. **Data Processing**: The retrieved randomness is hashed with a timestamp for additional entropy
3. **On-Chain Updates**: The processed randomness is pushed on-chain every minute
4. **Oracle Architecture**: Currently operates as a **pull-based oracle** rather than push

## Contract Architecture

### Core Contracts

- **`EOFeedManager.sol`**: Main oracle contract responsible for receiving and storing feed updates from whitelisted publishers
- **`EOFeedVerifier.sol`**: Handles verification of update payloads using BLS signatures and Merkle proofs

## Contract Address

**Deployed Contract**: [`0x5a38f4ee6E1da80B36fA94ad1d55f48a64F60572`](https://sepolia.arbiscan.io/address/0x5a38f4ee6E1da80B36fA94ad1d55f48a64F60572)

_Network: Arbitrum Sepolia_

## Integration

### For Developers

To integrate with the Orbitport cTRNG oracle:

1. **Use the Feed Adapter**: The `EOFeedAdapter` contract provides a Chainlink-compatible interface
2. **Access Latest Data**: Call `latestRoundData()` to get the most recent randomness
3. **Monitor Updates**: The oracle updates every minute with fresh randomness

## Future Improvements

This oracle implementation is designed for future enhancements:

- **EOracle Integration**: Full integration with EOracle infrastructure is planned
- **Push-Based Updates**: Transition from pull-based to push-based oracle architecture
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Expansion to additional blockchain networks

## Documentation

## Security

- Contracts are upgradeable and include emergency pause functionality
- BLS signature verification ensures data integrity
- Whitelisted publishers prevent unauthorized updates
- Merkle proof validation provides efficient verification
